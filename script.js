//Initialize two variables, highest and secondHighest, with -Infinity.
// Iterate over the array. For each element:
// If it’s greater than highest, update secondHighest with the value of highest, and update highest with the value of the current element.
// If it’s less than highest but greater than secondHighest, update secondHighest with the value of the current element.
// After the loop, return secondHighest
